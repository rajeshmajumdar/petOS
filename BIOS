How the BIOS finds an OS?

- Legacy Booting
    - BIOS loads the first sector of each bootable device into memory at location 0x7c00.
    - BIOS checks for a 0xaa55 signature
    - It found it, it starts executing it.
- EFI
    - BIOS looks into special EFI partitions.
    - OS must be compiled as an EFI program.
