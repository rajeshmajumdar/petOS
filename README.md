## petOS

This live repo contains the code of my petOS. I don't intend to make this OS anything useful, the whole intention behind this project is to learn OS Development.

As I keep on learning, I will keep updating the README page with necessary code. I am also keeping track of the dev logs, refer to dev-log for more detailed learning process.
